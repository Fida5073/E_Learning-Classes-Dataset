# Dataset Description
We collected consumer feedback from various social media sites, including Roman Urdu and English words, and stored it for our experiment. Over 185 days, from July 5, 2020, to January 10, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we gathered feedback from Facebook Pages, YouTube Channels, and Twitter accounts of different universities in Pakistan. The focus was on students' opinions and reviews about e-learning classes during the pandemic. Using key phrases like "Online classes in Pakistan during COVID-19 Pandemic," "the impact of COVID-19 on higher education in Pakistan," and "online classes announcement by Federal Minister of Pakistan Shafqat Mehmood," we extracted relevant opinions and reviews. The dataset was formatted in an Excel sheet with columns for sentiment, student reviews & comments, challenges & issues, sources, language, and sentiment target class. We used this data for sentiment classification based on machine learning algorithms.
