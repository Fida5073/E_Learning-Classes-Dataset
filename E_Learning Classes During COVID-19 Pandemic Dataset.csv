Negative," For the first time in our life, we can notice a renowned educational institute of KPK ""The University of Peshawar"" has failed in arranging classes (online classes on a proper platform) so arranging examinations without any deliberation. The university should not lay the rubble of its failures on the poor students.
It's a very unfair decision and mismanagement of the University announcing examinations just one week before, without declaring any prior details of date sheet, course code or examination chart... The teachers have no information, similarly, there are no precise details on the UOP website related to exam structure.
Every now and then we are hearing on news channels that examinations are postponed. Half of the remote region's students have internet issues. I don't realize if the university management is sleeping Or dreaming!!!
Our teacher's faculty should be concerned with this issue. We expect  that they will put forward this issue soon to clear out the confusions of our students Thanks...","#Internet Issue

1. Many universities are there, whose faculty cannot provide best in the physial environment....How could they 
effectively learn from those instructors?
2. Especially, many private universities just show off the formalities for conducting online classes...but we don't think 
about the education is smoothly run at immediately...
3. Hope, you also knew about the GPA effects, politics in universities,....All of the universities are not professional at
 online like e.g. VComsats lectures.So kindly, also think about the students grades.
4. There are the cases that urgant holidays for COVID-19 virus. Instructors put the final exams marks without conduct
 any exam...So what is this.... like an unrealistic, immature behavior?
5. Please don't implement your experiences with playing students careers. How could you say this.. You are trying for
 all studetns..? And thise students, for whom compulsion to drop semesters is realistic to you?
6. The systems you mentioned in the video... You should knew about the load on those system servers, stress load, 
response time & performances, reliability etc. as software system. 
For HEC, 1. Shortly, I think this would be enough for you about your online classes. All others matter are not effectively 
share here. 
2. Be thoughtful, and do a strong critical analysis for your systems, faculty etc. 
3. Kindly, first make your education system reliable, effective, and good be able to provide knowledge and training for
 all aspects of different fields of education.
Then, talk for online classes.

Negative,"1.Internet issue:

Mostly students are from backward areas that enjoy only 2G. Boys can go to outside to get 3G but what about girls?
Boys go outside, but there is no facilities in villages. A lot of noice, bad thinkings about the students about usage of mobile in our society disturbs the students.
Whats about battery of mobile phone while attending continuously 2,3 lectures for the students outside the village? 

2.Resources
Mostly students are from backward areas and belongs to middle class families, that have no such resources to buy mobile phones & laptops as well.So, students cannot attend classes.

3.Burden
There are too many lectures in a week (24 lec) with Saturday off. Why?
It's the month of Ramadan, month of more worship for muslims, the holy month. What you thik about Ramadan?
If we listen lectures, prepare or write them?
4 lectures in a day out of which 3 are continues. And most burden of assignments.

4.Health Disorders
Students body is also a human body! What you think about students health? 
Listening lectures or attending classes continuously using headphones disturb hearing of the body, and also damage mental rest and causes headache. 
Doctors said that continuously using mobile ?? phone is harmful to human body that's 100% true. What you think about eyesight problems of students. I hope if you continue online classes you will see 1 person out of 3 that will be the patient of eyesight, whose complete responsible will be our University. What you think about distancing of students from 'worship during Ramadan','Family members'?

5.Lecture issue
Some lectures also have voice issues.Some slides voice format is not supported by mostly mobiles. Its also a side effect of slides study that if a slide have audio of 5 minutes we cannot start fron 2nd minute, if we have some confusion in a slide then we have to start listening from beginning that losses our intention to study and causes disheartening. During lectures our phone run out of internet, after this we often not able to join the class. What's about data packages?
For notification  of announcements from teachers we have to check Google classroom again and again that's not a good thing during study and in the internet problems.

 is being said on social media ignoring the fact that students are using internet for social media meaning thereby they have access to stable internet per se. HEC fails to understand the underlying premise of these trends on social media. This is not a country where students love to study, its a place where students are only interested in extracurricular activities and nothing more. 
Students whose many years have been wasted due to various reasons are more worried than ever, some are in their final years 
to apply for any further education or jobs, and this delay is fatal for them. Students who are in their final semester and have 
attempted their mid exams are only waiting for their finals. No definite policy nor any plan has been announced by HEC for 
universities and students thereof. Internet was never the problem, but the will of HEC is and always was. Govt universities

 this online teaching process rest 70% is unsatisfied and in trouble. Now where the students are not even sure about the 
knowledge gathered through online sessions HEC has decided to arrange examinations (either online or sitting exams) 
when we are not prepared without even concerning our issues, how can someone attempt the exams without learning.
 Is it all about taking exams and huge fees from the students? Majority of the portion is on scholarship who will assure to 
pay their fee when they can?t maintain their grades? Moreover it?s not just about a semester, fee or scholarship it is about
 their career. How can HEC risk our career? Is there nobody to raise voice for us?

 it now we want media to draw government?s attention toward us.

Assalamualikum,
Respected sir;
As,the deliverance of current procedure of online examination by our university,we felt deeply about our examination system as
 it is not possible to conduct exams over lms 
There are many issues that can put us in difficulty:
Firstly, lms have their own server issues because while we are conducted online classes during this process we can't take online 
classes properly & when we open lms most of the time it was hanged so because of this we can't take proper online class and we 
aren't  guaranteed about the smooth run up of our online exams, interruption may cause failure to our examination.
Secondly, the lectures weren't sufficient for our understandings and were not as according to our classroom environment so, we 
are having problems in developing  our concepts regarding it by just reading the word document or attending forums. 
Lastly, there are many personal issues with many of the students, some don't have laptop facility while other have loading shedding
 & networking issues.so, it may cause a huge hurdle if we support this online examination. Our grades will be affected & moreover 
we won't be able to appear online. We want our university to promote us to our new session as per as previous grades or GPA. 
Thankyou!","#Due to poor internet connectivity LMS not properly working

 this pandemic situation, university students are facing the same issues. Online classes might be effective for the minor student

 this online teaching process rest 70% is unsatisfied and in trouble. Now where the students are not even sure about the 
knowledge gathered through online sessions HEC has decided to arrange examinations (either online or sitting exams) when 
we are not prepared without even concerning our issues, how can someone attempt the exams without learning. Is it all about 
taking exams and huge fees from the students? Majority of the portion is on scholarship who will assure to pay their fee when
 they can?t maintain their grades? Moreover it?s not just about a semester, fee or scholarship it is about their career. How can 
HEC risk our career? Is there nobody to raise voice for us?  
We have signed various petition regarding no online classes and no exams for university students but no one bothered about it 
now we want media to draw government?s attention toward us.

accessibility as it is in the best interest of all if prompted in accordance with previous GPA. I'm from FATA similarly, there are 
students like me from remote areas. What about us, we can have no access to even 3G sometimes even 2G. What steps have
 been taken into  consideration while taking us into account. Simply to say, it is not state-fascilitated or state-sponsored network.
 It takes me time while highlighting issues. Lots of issues are there. Secondly,  if it is most compulsory to take examination. 
Then, It is therefore requested to allow us for the span of time. 
Hope you take my plea into consideration.  
Thanking in anticipation.

hope you all are fine :)

i have an query , i  decide to share with you geo teaam members so kindly please take an step and resolve our query as soon as
 possible .

i am a student , and our education system started to deliver classes through online session ./
which is just a wastage of time , we don't able to grasp anything thru online sessions ,  and at the end it will just cause a severe
 headache and depression at all.

we faced a lot of difficulty thru this online sessions instead of learning , yes , we pay a lot of fee for single semester and our 
domain is to pass an exam well with good grades and so as a result  we will make our future well, and make our country name
 bright (developed country) IN SHA ALLAH ONE DAY.

but thru online session we faced a lot of hindrance , we payed a fee , we are student , we are future of our country , so we have
 a right to ask , why they do this with us ? is education is just a formality ? to complete the domain of courses?  if it is . so carry
 on this online session 
BUT
IF  its not a formality , IF its a major junk of of bright and smoothen life so please STOP this online session as soon as possible
 as you can.

no one is there to listen us.

if they dont response so its mean they forced us to PLAY A EHTAJAAJ which is not a good , thats the reason we humbly request to
 HEC management kindly please stop this please, please do not do this with us please. please take some other alternate way.

AGAIN PLEASE STOP THIS ONLINE SESSION , IT HAS NOT any single + IMPACT .


so kindly please raise our query.

 installation at their home. Providing students with internet facility (e.g. Wi-Fi) will not only facilitate the online learning/classes

It's a very unfair decision and mismanagement of the University announcing examinations just one week before, without
 declaring any prior details of date sheet, course code or examination chart...
The teachers have no information, similarly, there are no precise details on the UOP website related to exam structure.
Every now and then we are hearing on news channels that examinations are postponed. Half of the remote region's students

online platform with limited communication and continuous discrepancies, its very difficult for the teachers as well as for students. Just a waste of our semester we cannot afford to take our semester for granted like this
I request you to kindly take this matter into notice and consider the postponement of this semester. Surely this will be of immense benefit to the teachers as well as us students.
If not then please introduce a robust system
Many thanks

I and my friends are facing problems becoz of online learning. We are facing internet issues. We are supposed to submit 
assignments based on recorded lectures on moodle attach to student portal.there is no set up for live online classes. Mean while we are facing difficulties while doing our assignment.for a week we are supposed to submit assignments for all our subjects so there will be a heap of assignments at the end of semester perhaps with a little learning. Moreover for doing assignments students are getting help of each other. There is a huge gap between teachers n students as students are unable to communicate with their instructors. STudents of natural sciences are suffering a lot as they are deprived of performing experiments for core subjects. The student of maths n stat could suffer as if they have any question in their minds they can not ask while listening to recorded lecture.we are getting fed up of learning online just becoz of assignments,internet issues and lack of communication n proper understanding. We are in Quarantine and becoming depressed day by day. I request HEC to suspend the academic activities online untill our university arrange a proper set up for learning effectively..

1)
We r not getting the online classes because everytime your technical issues are not sort out so first solve all of your issues problems connections whatever then take some decision kindlyy??our time and money both are wasted so you should cancel this semester
2)
It is very difficult to understand teacher's point What he wants to say .main request krta hun Iqra sye k mrii full fee adjustment k sth semester drop krdiya jay.
3)
I am not satisfies with online classes please dont take online classes
4)
awaz ka issues hoty hain video mai bh masla hota h jiski waja sy bht problem horhe h class attende krny mai..
5)
The online classes are inappropriate, It is very hard to understand the topic as the teacher can not properly clear the concept or problem withour a board and we are not fully satisfied with the online classes
6)
This is very bad decision to take iqra university all of known that Pakistans network services are very Slow and bad so why they started online clases and i am requested to Head of Iqra uni Please Close the All online Classes B/C we should not try to understand our study
7)
There are so many issues while taking online classes.
1. INTERNET ISSUE.
2. VIDEO BUFFERING.
3. CONCEPT CLEAR NAHI HOTY
honesty online classes are talking so much efforts and energy from both (teacher n student) sides.
How can you learn or understand such courses online like business statistics FAP, Cost Accounting etc.
You can?t get even understand what?s your faculty is teaching you online in basic maths.
We?re not asking the management to refund our fees but at least respect our money and everybody?s time and please think about it.
Make a better alternate or lwithdraw this semester FOR GOD SAKE.
8)
Online classes is not for us. We?re completely fed of this
Teacher?s ko message kro ky samajh nhe aya dobara smjhadain gw msg hi nahi parhty. Ek ghanty parhaye ha rhy hain bas kisi bhi tarha maximun slides cover karsakain
9)
i'm not satisfied with the online classes as there are some issues conducting these online lectures and we dont get it much successfully so please resolve it
10)
i'm not satisfied with the online classes because it is not an intellectual and many of the students face difficulties such as internet issues etc.we face distractions during online classes
11)
online classes must be stopped because there are many technical issues
12)
humein questions poochnay me bht problems hoti hein or net me bhi bht problem hoti hai
13)
I am stuck here..out of city..so everything is bad..n its not like karachi lockdown..it is more like a curfew here.everything is close even banks..so yea there is also no net hereand my credit will go down at any moment..i will not able to take online classes please do something..
14)
online classes are like youtube tutorials we paid for 3 credit hour class not for 1 hour online session
15)
Sir i'm not satisfied from online classes because we are not a nation who have 50 mbs internet at their home.moreover we are not receive the quality education in a virtual classroom
16)
First of all its a flop idea because we aren't getting any knowledge about the topic because of lack of interaction with teacher.our concepts are not clear about the particular topic and it will effect our grades
17)WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ONLINE CLASSES.
But here is the main concern , it?s hard to get the better understanding via online classes. Since most of us have practical courses it?s impossible for us to understand through online classes.
Almost one month has passed by without any class (online) , majority of the students have no issues with their semester being FREEZED for further time period.
THE ONLINE CLASSES SYSTEM IS NOT AS PER TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, we are asked to open discussion forum instead of ZOOM (zoom par tou ese bhi nai samjh ata kuch , discussion forum par kia smjh aega) , most of the teachers don?t know how to work with technologies and stuff they aren?t able to deliver the lectures properly , we are facing many issues.
We all have paid heavy money for better understanding it will literally go to waste.
We won?t be able to take classes like this , Universities like NED , SIR SYED etc have also cancelled the semester it?s our request to Iqra University - IU to do the same for us.","#Technical issue

 cant work because we have to accept the fact that its not a digitally developed country ! Still some universities are trying to continue this flop initiative! We all know the situation of internet facilities in the remote areas of pakistan. Moreover due to this pandemic, it is difficult for some students to even get easy load from shops as they are closed. Still teachers are advising the students to appear online and attend the classes. And use apps like Zoom to attend their classes although HEC has declared these holidays as summer vacations. So why are there still classes ?Teachers are making whatsapp groups and uploading pdf files and ppts there and expecting us to understand the lectures and then ask questions regarding that?! Is this for real ? Why do we pay the universities then ? Cant we do all this from the start just by google everything !

Being a student and CR of perspective department i personally feels the Summer break is the genuine thing all universities can do right now.
How they will manage ?
They should have called us all again in actual summers , in_sha_Allah hopefully we will get out of this pandemic out break , no study loss nothing , if its not stopping universities have to build a more efficient system then this one ( *zoom* ) they are using the old softwares which are not really helpful always stuck,latency, distortion, and our university should have to give some boot camp allied sciences facility members how to use these softwares , addition to this many students are not really want to study either they make some kind of stupid remarks over teachers and valgur comments on the fellow classmates which is embarrassing in front of female students to have lectures and continue with that class , we will really been in trouble with or courses which needs our more attention, and the mathematics subjects cant perform like before we were doing in the university as we were all physically practicing with or teacher ,
As we also know we have the bad coverage of internet in northern areas of Pakistan !
All hostelzed students moved back beacuse of this this pandemic outbreak they are having alot trouble , am feeling very much keen to this topic beacuse am living in twin cities i personally got troubles with internet even , whether if its GSM data or Landline DSL companies what else i can say for the people who are living in Parachinar and Gilgit etc., please don't try to make all students fool by getting 70 thousand of their semester fee to getting zero video lecture knowledge if then YouTube is the greatest of all or we have to join any other virtualization system why we are paying if our university is not supporting poor and needy students , no body thing of those parents who are living by leaps and bounds, making the outbreak a real hustle for them that it's may not for them , who is responsible of the extra amounts for the internet packages, Is HEC announce any kind of funds for private sector or their work is only checking the degree program eligibility criteria for all universities , our university is a private university they are not facilitating students but the only option is to go for a summer break like other universities has already done ,??

Negative,"In light of the the COVID-19 outbreak and it?s current circumstances, the government has announced the continuation 
of university classes through online means. However, unfortunately, this method of course delivery has been a complete and utter failure. Live streaming an online lecture with more than 30 people at one time requires a strong fiber backed internet connectivity which majority of us students do not possess. We believe, in a country like Pakistan, it is almost impossible to have an internet connection strong enough to stream HD video in real time, and what is being shown to us is a blurred out stream where one can?t even see what?s going on in it. Video delay, lag, and playback buffering make lectures ineffective. The noise and disturbance in signals make the lecturer inaudible, moreover, the lecturers have no control over users, which allows outsiders to join in and further disrupt the classes. All of us have paid hefty sums of money as fees in order to gain quality education, which we currently aren?t receiving, and this is only leading to wastage of time and resources of both, teachers and students. This may adversely affect our GPA?s. A semester break, thus, is a suitable option, while extending dates for final examinations.

Upon these online classes now there's a new issue regarding the term paper, now we have to submit an assignment, a sort of research paper instead because we have to cover up the midterm exams in this way, are we a joke to you all, we can't even take online classes how are we supposed to do the term paper amongst so many limitations and restrictions, the major one in which is, unavailability of the internet. It is really nerve wracking for us; the people you call future of the nation. Well you are destroying the future of the nation. Some universities are very well aware of their technical deficiencies but are still forcefully taking online lectures and it has zero positive results. Now amongst all these technical, financial issues we have to constantly worry about not just taking online classes but also thinking how to submit the term paper with minor resources. It's not like the faculty follows the time table, classes are sometimes random and sometimes taken even on days which are off. What are we supposed to do, be on a watch 24/7 that now the class will start. This is callous attitude and ruining not only our grades but also our mental health. Mental health is not a joke, everyone is very well aware of the suicides that students commit because of your beautiful education system. Is it too hard to stop all these useless efforts of online classes till 31st may and let us all get a bit stable and breathe a little? Not even the teachers are comfortable with this system. Do not know what the university authorities are saying but if maximum 37 students are able to take online classes (even they have issues) out of 100 plus students then it's a big problem. And this is the number of one semester only. What did these students do to deserve this, was it their fault that this pandemic broke out and countries had to go under lock down?

Taking note of this HEC has announced that the online classes system will be closed and all the institutions will remain closed till 31st May 2020 and these vocations will be given name as some sort of summer vocations etc. The country is under severe condition of Coronavirus and obviously due to Lockdown the businesses and all other ways of earning are closed.

As it is a well known fact that Chinese unversities are leading in the world in terms of scientific publication. There are alot reseaons behind this progress. One of the reasons is that in most of the casis there minimum faculty selection criteria is PhD and certian no of publication.
You can go to any chinese uni website and confirm that 90 percent or higher faculty hold PhD degrees.
Now have a look at Pakistani HEC policies and politicized varsities system.you only need a strong reference, it can be be commisioner, CM, Governor or any academic big gun..
On the other side foreign and local PhDs are on strik due to unemployment.
Tariq banori, mukhtar ahmed, pervaiz Hoodbhoy they all know this.
There is only one solution at this level.mininum criteria to be part of a university faculty should be PhD...yes minimum eligibility criteria even for lecturer should be PhD.
Secondly thing is improving quality of research for which HEC is in processes of making things stringent.

Internet required for Online Classes must be more than 20 GB as there will be at least three consecutive classes.Monthly 20 GB internet expenses are about 600 it's mean that every student will have to consume at least 1000 Rupees on internet every month,so, how poor students will afford this?

The vice chancellor;
Jinnah university for women karachi.
Assalamualikum,
Respected sir;
As,the deliverance of current procedure of online examination by our university,we felt deeply about our examination system as it is not possible to conduct exams over lms 
There are many issues that can put us in difficulty:
Firstly, lms have their own server issues because while we are conducted online classes during this process we can't take online classes properly & when we open lms most of the time it was hanged so because of this we can't take proper online class and we aren't  guaranteed about the smooth run up of our online exams, interruption may cause failure to our examination.
Secondly, the lectures weren't sufficient for our understandings and were not as according to our classroom environment so, we are having problems in developing  our concepts regarding it by just reading the word document or attending forums. 
Lastly, there are many personal issues with many of the students, some don't have laptop facility while other have loading shedding & networking issues.so, it may cause a huge hurdle if we support this online examination. Our grades will be affected & moreover we won't be able to appear online. We want our university to promote us to our new session as per as previous grades or GPA. 
Thankyou!",#online examination issue,Youtube,English,2,
Negative,"Higher Education Commission (HEC) is under the order of our government, not only the schools and colleges are going through this pandemic situation, university students are facing the same issues. Online classes might be effective for the minor student community but the major portion is going through a lot of trouble, approximately 30% are understanding and learning through this online teaching process rest 70% is unsatisfied and in trouble. Now where the students are not even sure about the knowledge gathered through online sessions HEC has decided to arrange examinations (either online or sitting exams) when we are not prepared without even concerning our issues, how can someone attempt the exams without learning. Is it all about taking exams and huge fees from the students? Majority of the portion is on scholarship who will assure to pay their fee when they can?t maintain their grades? Moreover it?s not just about a semester, fee or scholarship it is about their career. How can HEC risk our career? Is there nobody to raise voice for us?  
We have signed various petition regarding no online classes and no exams for university students but no one bothered about it now we want media to draw government?s attention toward us. 
We demand to be promoted to next semester either on the basis of previous result or the upcoming semesters result after the COVID-19 .
WE DEMAND NO EXAMINATION FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENT TILL THIS COVID-19 OR PROPER REGULAR CLASSES.
Save our result save our career.

What steps have been taken into  consideration while taking us into account. Simply to say, it is not state-fascilitated or state-sponsored network. It takes me time while highlighting issues.

Negative,"1.Internet issue:

Mostly students are from backward areas that enjoy only 2G. Boys can go to outside to get 3G but what about girls?
Boys go outside, but there is no facilities in villages. A lot of noice, bad thinkings about the students about usage of mobile in our society disturbs the students.
Whats about battery of mobile phone while attending continuously 2,3 lectures for the students outside the village? 

2.Resources
Mostly students are from backward areas and belongs to middle class families, that have no such resources to buy mobile phones & laptops as well.So, students cannot attend classes.

3.Burden
There are too many lectures in a week (24 lec) with Saturday off. Why?
It's the month of Ramadan, month of more worship for muslims, the holy month. What you thik about Ramadan?
If we listen lectures, prepare or write them?
4 lectures in a day out of which 3 are continues. And most burden of assignments.

4.Health Disorders
Students body is also a human body! What you think about students health? 
Listening lectures or attending classes continuously using headphones disturb hearing of the body, and also damage mental rest and causes headache. 
Doctors said that continuously using mobile ?? phone is harmful to human body that's 100% true. What you think about eyesight problems of students. I hope if you continue online classes you will see 1 person out of 3 that will be the patient of eyesight, whose complete responsible will be our University. What you think about distancing of students from 'worship during Ramadan','Family members'?

5.Lecture issue
Some lectures also have voice issues.Some slides voice format is not supported by mostly mobiles. Its also a side effect of slides study that if a slide have audio of 5 minutes we cannot start fron 2nd minute, if we have some confusion in a slide then we have to start listening from beginning that losses our intention to study and causes disheartening. During lectures our phone run out of internet, after this we often not able to join the class. What's about data packages?
For notification ?? of announcements from teachers we have to check Google classroom again and again that's not a good thing during study and in the internet problems.

 are tweeting whatever they are being fed by the their team heads on daily basis. Students have internet for whatsapp, twitter and facebook, but not for the educational purposes. What is more startling and disastrous is that HEC is actually believing whatever is being said on social media ignoring the fact that students are using internet for social media meaning thereby they have access to stable internet per se. HEC fails to understand the underlying premise of these trends on social media. This is not a country where students love to study, its a place where students are only interested in extracurricular activities and nothing more. Students whose many years have been wasted due to various reasons are more worried than ever, some are in their final years to apply for any further education or jobs, and this delay is fatal for them. Students who are in their final semester and have attempted their mid exams are only waiting for their finals. No definite policy nor any plan has been announced by HEC for universities and students thereof. Internet was never the problem, but the will of HEC is and always was. Govt universities never cared about students or anything else, private universities only care about money. No one is concerned about the so called future of country (the students).",,Youtube,English,1,
